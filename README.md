## My First Electron App: Simple Notepad 📝

### Introduction
Welcome to my first Electron app! I'm just starting out and this project is a simple playground to learn and experiment.

### Description 📚
The aim of this project is to create a simple notepad-like application. It's designed to take in text input and display it back to you. Right now, it's in its infancy—just type some text into an input field, hit a button, and see your text displayed on the screen.

**Note**: I am kinda fond of this concept, so expect to see it more polished and feature-rich in the final version.
